xde-winlist: works pretty good.

* [x] Start documentation (manual page)
* [x] Complete documentation (manual page)
* [ ] the purpose of this program was to display a graphical window
      list a feedback when cycling windows using the keyboard.
* [ ] convert to consider monitors when listing windows.  Unless all
      monitors are selected, only show windows on the active monitor.

xde-winmenu: works really good

* [x] this is a command that can be used to popup a window menu
      for any window.  Note that it uses libwnck++ which is needed
      by many of the programs in this package.  We invoke this
      program from the Alt-Space key sequence to always be able to
      pop a window menu.  ADWM does not have internal menus, so a
      click on the titlebar or menu button uses this program to
      pop the window menu.  It think that it is finished.
* [x] Works like a charm.  Use it all the time.
* [ ] convert to consider monitors when listing windows.  Unless all
      monitors are selected, only show windows on the active monitor.

* [x] Complete documentation (manual page)
