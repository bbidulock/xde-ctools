@PACKAGE@ -- read me first file.  @DATE@

@PACKAGE@
=========

Package @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ was released under GPL license @DATE@.

This package provides a number of "C"-language tools for working with
the X Desktop Envionment.  Most of these tools were previously written
in perl(1) and were part of the xde-tools package.  They have now been
codified in "C" for speed and to provide access to libraries not
available from perl(1).

Quick Start:

    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install
