xde-winmenu - Window Actions Menu for XDE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xde-winmenu> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a window menu for window managers that do not provide one
themselves or as a better window menu for those that provide an inferior
one.  The window menu is a menu of actions that can be performed against
a window and is normally accessed with a hot-key, or by clicking on the
decorative border of a window, or by pressing one or more modifier keys
and clicking on the window.  B<xde-winmenu> supports all of these
activations.  See L</USAGE> and L</WINDOW MANAGERS> for more information
about activation.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<xde-winmenu> accepts the following options:

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

When specified, the following optios alter the primary operating mode of
the program:

=over

=item [B<--popup>, B<-p>]

Post a popup menu.  Depending on the setting of the B<--button> option,
this will either post the popup menu at the current pointer position, or
centered on the window to which it corresponds.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>

Prints usage information and the current options settings and defaults
nad exits.

=item B<--version>, B<-V>

Prints the version of the program and a brief copyright statement and
exits.  Parse the first line with L<awk(1)> to obtain just the version
number.

=item B<--copying>, B<-C>

Prints the long copying permissions statement and exits.

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following options are general options:

=over

=item B<--display>, B<-d> I<DISPLAY>

Specify the display to use (overriding the B<DISPLAY> environment
variable).  The default is the value of the B<DISPLAY> environment
variable.

=item B<--screen>, B<-s> I<SCREEN>

Specify the screen number to use when locating the client window.  The
default is either specified by the B<DISPLAY> environment variable
(which that variable specifies a screen); otherwise, all screens will be
considered.

=item B<--button>, B<-b> I<BUTTON>

Specifies the button that was used to invoke the popup.  Defaults to
zero (0).  This should be the button that was used to pop the menu.  A
window manager that invokes this command in response to a button press
should release its passive grab on the button before invoking the window
menu so that the popped up menu can grab the button.  A I<BUTTON> of
zero (0) means that the program was invoked with a key-press instead of
a button.

=item B<--timestamp>, B<-T> I<TIMESTAMP>

Provides the X11 server timstamp of the event that caused the popup.

=item B<--which>, B<-w> {B<active>|B<focused>|B<pointer>|B<select>}

Specifies the window for which the popup the menu.  This can be one of
the following values (case insensitive, may be abbreviated):

=over

=item C<active>

Popup a menu for the active window (in the EWMH sense).  This is the
window specified by the B<_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW> property on the root
window.

=item C<focused>

Popup a menu for the focused window (in the EWMH sense or simply the
client with the keyboard focus).  This is the with with a
B<_NET_WM_STATE_FOCUSED> atom set in B<_NET_WM_STATE>, or the client
(visible client with the B<WM_STATE> property set to state C<Normal>)
that has keyboard focus according to the X server.

If no focused window can be found (e.g. focus is on the root window),
window selection falls back to C<pointer> as described below.

This is the default when B<--button> is unspecified, or specified as
zero.

=item C<pointer>

Popup a menu for the client holding a pointer grab or the client
or window manager frame directly under the pointer.

This is the default when B<--button> is specified and non-zero.

=item C<select>

Select the client for which the window menu should be posted by having
the user click on the window.  Use the normal X window selection
protocol.

=item I<WINDOW>

Select the window with XID, I<WINDOW>, for posting of menu.

=back

When a client window cannot be found, B<xde-winmenu> complains and
exits.

=item B<--id>, B<-x> I<WINDOW>

Specify the X window identifier (XID) of the EWMH/NetWM client window
for which to popup a menu.  Can also specified with B<--which>.

=item B<--verbose>, B<-v> [I<LEVEL>]

Increases or sets the the output verbosity level to I<LEVEL>.  The
default level is C<1>.  Normal output is printed to standard output.
This option may be repeated.

=item B<--debug>, B<-D> [I<LEVEL>]

Increases or sets the debugging verbosity level to I<LEVEL>.  The
default level is C<0>.  Debugging output is printed to standard error.
This option may be repeated.

=back

=head1 USAGE

B<xde-winmenu> currently uses F<libwnck+> or F<libwnck> both to identify
the window manager and to provide the window actions menu.  The range
and format of window actions provided by F<libwnck+> is superior to
F<libwnck>.  This use means that B<xde-winmenu> does not currently
provide any support for window managers that do not have a modicum of
compliance to the EWMH/NetWM specifications.  That may change in the
future.
