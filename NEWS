Release xde-ctools-1.10 released 2019-09-03
-------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 1.10

1.10            Maintenance Release 1.10

    This is the tenth release of the xde-ctools package. This package
    contains various tools (menus, popup, pages, feedback mechanisms) for
    the X Desktop Environment (XDE). These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. Not all the
    tools are complete, but the many that are work nicely. The nice ones I
    use daily and are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release that simply provides better
    autoconf directory defaults and improves the build process more. It
    also gets around gcc 9.1 compiler string truncation stupidity.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 1.9...1.10

      keep gnits
      better autoconf directory defaults
      better defaults now
      build release notes with distribution
      get around gcc 9.1 compiler stupidity


Release xde-ctools-1.9 released 2019-09-01
------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 1.9

1.9             Maintenance Release 1.9

    This is the ninth release of the xde-ctools package. This package
    contains various tools (menus, popup, pages, feedback mechanisms) for
    the X Desktop Environment (XDE). These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. Not all the
    tools are complete, but the many that are work nicely. The nice ones I
    use daily and are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release that updates the build process,
    generates better NEWS files, handles annotated tags better, and updates
    the release archive to lzip compression.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.

git tag -n100 -l 1.8

1.8             Maintenance Release 1.8

    This is the eighth release of the xde-ctools package. This package
    contains various tools (menus, popup, pages, feedback mechanisms) for
    the X Desktop Environment (XDE). These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. Not all the
    tools are complete, but the many that are work nicely. The nice ones I
    use daily and are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release and fixes some issues with GNU
    options. It also adds the xde-sound feedback utility that plays event
    sound effects in response to desktop events. It fixes a crash in
    xde-setbg when it is run too early (before any desktops are set up at
    all).

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the release
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information.

Release xde-ctools-1.7 released 2018-01-06
------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 1.7

1.7             Maintenance Release 1.7

    This is the seventh release of the xde-ctools package. This package
    contains various tools (menus, popup, pages, feedback mechanisms) for
    the X Desktop Environment (XDE). These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. Not all the
    tools are complete, but the many that are work nicely. The nice ones I
    use daily and are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release and fixes some issues with
    startup notification. It also adds an opacity option to most of the
    tools for use with composite managers. Also, some file managers do not
    like the file:// prefix on file names at all (e.g. pcmanfm) so
    xde-recent now strips them. Centered dialogues now use center window
    gravity to place themselves in the center of the screen. xde-pager now
    correctly updates its layout when the number of workspaces changes, and
    behaves better when hot keys are pressed while it is popped. Manual
    page updates.

    Starting with this release, commits are verified and tags are signed
    and annotated (with this text).

    Includes in the release is an Arch Linux source tarball (also on the
    AUR) and an autoconf tarball for building the release from source. See
    the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more information.
