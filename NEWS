Release xde-ctools-1.15 released 2022-01-29
-------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 1.15

1.15            Maintenance Release 1.15

    This is the fifteenth release of the xde-ctools package. This package
    contains various tools (menus, popup, pages, feedback mechanisms) for
    the X Desktop Environment (XDE). These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. Not all the
    tools are complete, but the many that are work nicely. The nice ones I
    use daily and are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release that updates for compilation with
    GCC 11.1.0 as well as providing updates to the autoconf tool chain.
    Also included is gh-pages with some screen shots of the tools in
    action. Some manual page corrections are also included.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
