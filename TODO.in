@PACKAGE@ -- TODO file.  @DATE@

Work to do on commands:

xde-app: works pretty good

- [X] this is an xdg application launcher much like a command
      dialog but launches XDG programs.
- [ ] I think that it is finished.
- [ ] convert program to use GtkRecentManager object.

xde-clip: does not do much yet

- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Complete program.

xde-cycle: not fully functional yet

- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] doesn't really do much yet.
- [ ] this was supposed to put up a window list that could
      be displayed while windows are being cycled much in
      the same fashion as the xde-pager feelback.

xde-desktop: not fully functional yet.

- [X] Move to it's own package.
- [ ] Move this back into xde-ctools at some point.

xde-dock: doesn't work so well yet

- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] this works a little bit and was kinda based on flipse.
- [ ] needs work to operate correctly, have configuration,
      and do nice things like autohide the panel and choose
      configurations

xde-keys: not fully functional yet

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] this was supposed to be our own kind of bbkeys thing
      where a basic set of key definitions that do not rely
      on the window manager internals could be specified in
      a single location
- [ ] haven't really done that much work yet.

xde-pager: works pretty good

- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [X] I use this one all the time.  It think that it is finished.
- [ ] Might want to provide a keyboard-only option.
- [ ] Fix harmful interaction with icewm edge page switcher.

xde-places: works pretty good

- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [X] I use this one often.  I think that it is finished.
- [X] Integrate into panel.

xde-preferred: not written yet

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Finish writing this command.

xde-recent: works well

- [X] I use this one often.  I think that it is finished.
- [X] Integrate into panel.
- [ ] Provide more tooltips with counts and dates.

xde-run: works pretty good

- [X] this is a command application launcher similar to xde-app.
- [ ] I think that it is finished.
- [ ] convert program to use GtkRecentManager object.

xde-select: not fully functional yet

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] Finish writing this command.

xde-setbg: works really good

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] this is a multiple backdrop changer that changes backdrop
      according to a style or theme when the desktop changes.

xde-winlist: works pretty good.

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [ ] the purpose of this program was to display a graphical window
      list a feedback when cycling windows using the keyboard.

xde-winmenu: works pretty good

- [X] this is a command that can be used to popup a window menu
      for any window.  Note that it uses libwnck++ which is needed
      by many of the programs in this package.  We invoke this
      program from the Alt-Space key sequence to always be able to
      pop a window menu.  ADWM does not have internal menus, so a
      click on the titlebar or menu button uses this program to
      pop the window menu.  It think that it is finished.
- [X] Works like a charm.  Use it all the time.

xde-wkspmenu: works well

- [X] Start documentation (manual page)
- [X] Complete documentation (manual page)
- [X] Finish writing this command.
