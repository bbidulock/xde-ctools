xde-ctools
===============

Package `xde-ctools-1.14.12` was released under GPLv3 license
2021-12-04.

This package provides a number of "C"-language tools for working with
the _X Desktop Environment_.  Most of these tools were previously
written in `perl(1)` and were part of the `xde-tools` package.  They
have now been codified in "C" for speed and to provide access to
libraries not available from `perl(1)`.

For screenshots and examples, see [SAMPLES](samples/index.html).

The source for `xde-ctools` is hosted on [GitHub][1].
